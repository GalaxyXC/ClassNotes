"Package, dependency and environment management for any language: Python, R, Ruby, Lua, Scala, Java, Javascript, C/ C++, FORTRAN
Conda is an open source package management system and environment management system for installing multiple versions of 
software packages and their dependencies and switching easily between them. It works on Linux, OS X and Windows, 
and was created for Python programs but can package and distribute any software.

Miniconda is a small “bootstrap” version that includes only conda, Python, and the packages they depend on. 
Over 720 scientific packages and their dependencies can be installed individually from the Continuum repository 
with the “conda install” command."

> Setting up Environmental Variables (for win10)
# Debug since Terminal prompt " 'conda' is not recognized as an internal or external command... "
PATH variable: Control Panel\System and Security\System\Advanced System Settings > [Environmental Variables...] > System Variables > path

> install osmnx with conda
while in terminal:
conda install -c conda-forge osmnx

> install packages in pip

> Code for Nolli Plot
#### Start ####
import osmnx as ox
from Ipython.display import Image
ox.config(log_file = True, log_console = True, use_cache = True)

# config the inline image display
img_folder = 'images'
extension = 'png'
size = 350

place = 'Emory'
point = (33.785, -84.324)
fig, ax = ox.plot_figure_ground(point = point, filename = place, network_type = 'all', dpi = 150)
Image('{}/{}.{}'.format(image_folder, place, extension), height=size, width = size)
